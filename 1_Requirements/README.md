## Introduction

    A Calculator is a device which is used to perform scientific and mathematical operations.

    The first E-Calculator was introduced in the early 1960's.Intel developed the first microprocessor for the japanese calculator company Busicom.Later,it is used commonly by everyone in petroleum industries. Calculators become very popular when they are reduced in size and cost,and they are very commonly used in schools.Computer Os,as far back as early UNIX had an interactive calculator program such as DC and HOC,and calculator functions are included almost in all PDA(Personal Digital Assistant) type devices.Modern Calculators vary from cheaper to higher priced,which is rated by their differences in use.In addition to General purpose calculators, there are some calculators which are specifically designed for the markets.For Example - There are scientific calculators which perform trigonometric and statistical functions.So,they are different in their usage levels. 

## Objective

    - To create a Calculator that performs mathematical operations with many optimized features.

## Benefit

	- Easy performing operations.
	- Perform calculations more quickly.
	- Using new features introduced.

## Features

	- Enabled combination and permutaion operations.
	- Introduced LCM & HCF.
	- Reduced complex operations.

## What

	A Calculator application allows the user to perform mathematical operations digitally.It is simple and easy to perform.

## Why 

	To perform Calculations more quickly.
	
## When

	A user can use the calculator to perform any mathematical operations more quickly.The implemented calculator is easy to use ,as it does not contain many complex operations.

## Where

	Used by everyone in the world.
